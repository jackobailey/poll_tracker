## Notes

Understanding polls is harder than it should be. Whether because they don't understand, or because it sells newspapers, journalists often report on changes in the polls as though they are meaningful. More often than not, this is not the case. Instead, political polling is subject to all sorts of noise that can lead to the appearance of change where none really exists. This includes simple random variation and persistent "house effects" attributable to the different methodologies that each pollster uses.

The purpose behind my poll tracker is to cut through this noise and to present the results as clearly as possible.

This repository contains all of the files necessary to replicate the poll-tracking graphics that I sometimes post on Twitter. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open an issue or contact me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/PoliSciJack) or by [email](mailto:jack.bailey@manchester.ac.uk).
